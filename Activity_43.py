# 1) Import the `turtle` library to use turtle graphics.
import turtle
# 2) Create a turtle screen window and store it in `my_wn`.
my_wn = turtle.Screen()
# 3) Set up the screen:
# a) Change the background color to "light blue".
my_wn.bgcolor("cyan")
# b) Set the window title to "Turtle".
my_wn.title("Turtle")
# 4) Create a Turtle object and store it in `my_pen`.
my_pen = turtle.Turtle()
my_pen.color("orange")
my_pen.pencolor("red")
# (This turtle will draw the pattern.)

# (This turtle will draw the pattern.)

# 5) Initialize `size = 0`.
size = 0
# (This variable controls how long each side of the square will be.)

# 6) Start an infinite loop using `while True` so the drawing continues forever.
while True:
    for i in range(4):
        my_pen.forward(size + 1)
        my_pen.left(90)
        size -= 5
    size += 1
# 7) Inside the infinite loop, draw a square using a `for` loop that runs 4 times:

# a) Move the turtle forward by `size + 1`.

# b) Turn the turtle left by 90 degrees to make a right angle.

# c) Decrease `size` by 5 after each side.

# 8) After completing one square (4 sides), increase `size` by 1.

# (This changes the size value for the next iteration, creating a repeating pattern.)
