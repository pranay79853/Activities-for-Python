# 1) Take two integer inputs from the user and store them in `lower` and `upper`.
lower = int(input("Enter the lower bound: "))
upper = int(input("Enter the upper bound: "))
# (These represent the starting and ending range.)

# 2) Print a message showing the range: from `lower` to `upper`.
print(f"Prime numbers between {lower} and {upper} are:")
# 3) Use a loop to check every number `num` from `lower` to `upper` (inclusive).
for num in range(lower, upper + 1):
    if num > 1:
        for i in range(2, num):
            if num % i == 0:
                break
        else:
            print(num)
# 4) For each `num`, first check if it is greater than 1.

# (Because prime numbers are always greater than 1.)

# 5) If `num` is greater than 1, test if it is prime:

# a) Try dividing `num` by every number `i` from 2 to `num - 1`.

# b) If `num` is divisible by any `i` (remainder is 0), it is NOT prime → stop checking (break).

# 6) If the loop finishes without finding any divisor (no break happened),

# then `num` is prime → print `num`.
